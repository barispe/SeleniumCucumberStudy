- UI automated functional test for https://demos.openvidu.io/basic-videoconference/
- Test scenario is at .\src\test\resources\com\automatedtest\sample
- Java 8 JDK
- Tests will run on Chrome with a fake UI on video conference by default
- Thread.sleep has not been used therefor tests can run a bit fast to watch , wait utils  can be added between the steps to see scenario actions better.
